          <p>The primary goal for this site is to make the statistical data <b>visually engaging and accessible in english, spanish, and french languages</b>. The micro site was to be hosted on github pages so it needed to be built as a static website. </p>

            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Approach & Direction</h2>
            <p>In partnering with design we kicked a few ideas back and forth until we landed on making the experience of the site feel organic. We wanted to play off of the organic shape of a microscopic cell.</p>
            <p>When you look at a cell there is always some movement on a microscopic level. We decided to take that idea and make text and image shapes that felt like you were looking under a microscope.</p>
            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Design Review</h2>
            <p>We landed on making a chapter approach that has six pages or chapters to tell this whole story. These chapters would be broken down into the following chapters:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A new future for health</li>
              <li>Health as a barometer
              <li>Health and equality</li>
              <li>Health and biodiversity</li>
              <li>Development on fast forward</li>
              <li>A global stress test</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Execution</h2>
            <p>With the mobile first approach we wanted the website to be slim and not have to rely on heavy frameworks.</p>
            <p>I built the site using webpack which translated my SCSS into CSS as well as minified the javascript for this website.  This allowed us to streamline the code for production. .</p>
            <h3 class="highlight">Challenges</h3>
            <p>The challenge was the images that were organic shapes needed to have an overlay to display the image credit. The images had a drop shadow â€˜s that needed to be dependent on the element that it was on. </p>
            <figure class="alignwide">
              <figcaption>The organic shapes</figcaption>
                <img src="./assets/img/undp-blob.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <h3 class="highlight">Solution</h3>
            <p>The organic image shapes proved to be challenging for all the things that it was doing. After trial and error I discovered that you can manipulate boxes to have an organic shape by using a border-radius like the following: <b>(border-radius: 71% 42% 45% 69%/25% 43% 69% 89%;)</b></p>
            <p>This is the effect that we were going for to create those organic shapes. The benefit of it being border-radius is that I can tie that to an animation and make those shapes infinitely move in a slow amoeba like way. </p>
            <p>The shapes we could make on a div which had the img element inside. Taking advantage of pseudo elements we could create an overlay and the text to pop over the image when the right action takes place. </p>

            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I am glad that I was able to be a part of this project. Everytime I am able to work closely with design I learn something new. This definitely pushed what I thought could be possible with CSS. I am always anxious to learn more and push the boundaries. </p>
