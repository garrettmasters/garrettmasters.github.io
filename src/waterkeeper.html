          <p class="title-intro"><span class="highlight">Goals & Objectives</span></p>
          <p>The primary goal of this website is to provide a <b>visual way to view impact of local water conservation efforts.</b> The previous website didn't have a way to express the scale of waterkeeper alliance and it's partners</p>

            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Approach & Direction</h2>
            <p>We wanted to streamline the process of a user finding waterkeepers in their area. The previous website brought the user to a large list of all the waterkeepers.</p>
            <p>This list was categories by country and was searchable but lacked a visual representation of how much affect local waterkeepers are making.</p>

               <img src="./assets/img/before-waterkeeper-flow.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <p>I partnered with design to find a way to show the global scale of what waterkeeper alliance is doing but bring that to a relatable local level.</p>
            <p>We wanted to take the broad to narrow approach by focusing on the global scale and narrowing down to the country and then to the local waterkeeper. </p>

            </figure>
            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Design Review</h2>
            <p>The user flow for navigating waterkeeper jurisdictions had the map as a central navigation piece between all steps.</p>
            <p>Taking the opportunity of the region level to highlight stats of that region. Until the user makes their way to the local jurisdiction where they can find a bio and contact information to get involved. </p>

            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Execution</h2>
            <p>I build the frontend of the site from scratch as I did not want to introduce unnecessary code that comes along with most frameworks.</p>
            <p>Their data of all the map jurisdictions lived in ESRI. I used ESRI’s ArcGIS API to pull the map layer and populate it with the regions and jurisdictions.</p>
            <p>The individual waterkeeper’s information was stored in salesforce, so I leveraged salesforce API to pull that data and populate the waterkeeper detail page. </p>

                <img src="./assets/img/waterkeeperflow.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <h3 class="highlight">Challenges</h3>
            <p>I needed to find a way to tie the map data with the waterkeepers information.</p>
            <p>I could populate the waterkeepers region page with the data from salesforce. I could also populate the map with the data from ESRI.</p>
            <p>However I needed to find a way to interact with the map and have the ability to click on a location and have it take you to the region or local waterkeeper</p>
            <figure class="alignwide">
              <figcaption>developed waterkeeper detail page</figcaption>
               <img src="./assets/img/waterkeeper-detail.jpg" />
            </figure>
            <h3 class="highlight">Solution</h3>
            <p>Hidden in the ESRI data map data was the saleforce ID for each waterkeeper jurisdiction. I was able to leverage this ID and pass it into the url as a parameter.</p>
            <p>From there I was able to pull in the url param of the salesforce ID and do a lookup to return the information relating to that local waterkeeper.</p>
            <h2 class="highlight heading-intro">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This was a fun visually satisfying project. Leveraging the API’s of waterkeeper alliance current data sources will allow their site to be current and dynamic for the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p>The collaboration and team work from strategy, design and development allowed this project to be completed on time and under budget. It was a team effort that I was glad to be a part of.</p>
